            In most stories regarding the Minotaur, he is located at the center of a great Labyrinth. In Greek mythology, he resided in the
            center of a great maze called the Labyrinth, constructed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus on the command of King Minos
            of Crete.

            Fun Fact: In Greek mythology, after ascending to the throne of Crete, King Minos prayed to the sea god Poseidon for a white bull
            as a sign of the god's favor. Minos was to sacrifice the bull to honor Poseidon, but decided to keep the bull instead and find 
            another sacrifice for the god. However, Poseidon decided to punish Minos for this. The sea god made Minos's wife Pasiphae fall 
            in love with a bull, and thuse the Minotaur was born from Minos's wife.

            While the Minotaur was shown love at first, the creature became more and more ferocious, and began devouring humans for sustinance.
            As such, Minos, taking advice from the oracle at Delphi, had the Labyrinth constructed for the sole purpose of holding the Minotaur.

        <p class="main">
            King Minos' son, Androgeus, was later killed by Athenians who were jelous of his numerous wins at the Panathenaic festival. As a 
            punishment, a cruel plague was set upon the Athenians. The King of Athens, Aegeus, had to avert the plague caused by his crime by
            sending seven Athenian youths and seven maidens into the Labyrinth to be devoured by the Minotaur.
        </p>
        <p id="funfact">
            Fun Fact: In other versions of the story, Androgeus is killed at Marathon by the Cretan Bull, his mother's former lover, whom
            Aegeus commanded him to slay.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
            When the third sacrifice came, Aegeus's son, Theseus, volunteered to slay the creature. In Crete, Minos's daughter, Ariadne, fell
            madly in love with Theseus. She helped him navigate the Labyrinth with a ball of thread, allowing Theseus to retrace his steps. 
            Theseus killed the Minotaur either with his bare hands, a club, or a sword, depending on the version of the story being told. Theseus
            led the Athenians out of the Labyrinth and sailed back to Athens. Before he returned, however, Aegeus killed himself, believeing that
            his son had died fighting the creature. This act secured the throne for Theseus.

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p class="main">
            The Minotaur is a creature with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man.
        </p>
        <p id="funfact">
            Fun Fact: The Roman poet Ovid described the creature as "ex parte homo et ex parte taurus", or "part man and part bull".
        </p>
        <p class="main">
            Due to Ovid's latin account of the Minotaur, in which he does not specify which part of the creature is which, cultures
            through the Middle Ages had different depictions of the Minotaur. Some later depictions show the creature with the head of a man
            and the body of a bull, reminicent of a centaur. However, the classical depiction is that of a creature with the head of a bull
            and the body of a man.
